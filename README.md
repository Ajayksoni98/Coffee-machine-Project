# Coffee-machine-Project
### about ###
In this project, I  worked on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups, if it runs out of something, it shows a notification.
You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money.

### Learning ###
This project allows us to get a taste of Python. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Python.
